# AdvancedTopics-Week3
## Major Developments

### Goals:
The goals for this week were to work with styles and themes, specifically Material3, to create a style template that I actually liked, to be used in future apps
### Problems Encountered
#### Problem 1: Applying a shape appearance to a custom button
I would like to make my custom buttons be less rounded than they are. I tried doing this with a shape appearance, as mentioned in the docs. However, while changing the cornerFamily property (rounded, cut) works, tweaking the cornerSize property does not seem to do anything. This means I can have either completely rounded corners, or completely cut.
##### Status: Unsolved

### App Completion Status
This app has been fully completed
